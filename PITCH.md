# Product Pitch: Prashant Hair Saloon App

Here are a few templates you can use to DM or show the owner.

## Option 1: The "Problem Solver" Pitch (Best for WhatsApp/DM)
*Focuses on fixing the headache of customers asking "How long will it take?"*

> "Hi Prashant bhai! 👋 I’ve built a custom **Digital Queue System** for your saloon.
>
> 🚀 **The Problem:** Customers hate waiting or calling to ask 'Is there a rush?'.
> ✅ **The Solution:** They can now see the **Live Queue** on their phone and join from home!
>
> **Check it out here:** [Your-Link-Here]
>
> It shows:
> 1. Your Live Queue (who is serving, who is waiting).
> 2. Estimated Wait Time ⏳.
> 3. Your premium branding & photos 📸.
>
> This makes the saloon look super professional and saves you from answering 'kitna time lagega?' calls. Let me know if you want to try it out!"

## Option 2: The "Premium Brand" Pitch (In-Person/Professional)
*Focuses on branding and modernizing the business.*

> "Prashant Hair Saloon is a premium brand, so it deserves a premium digital experience. I've developed a professional web app that does two things:
>
> 1.  **Modernizes your Booking:** Instead of a notebook, you have a digital list. Customers join via their phone, and you just click 'Next' when you're ready.
> 2.  **Impresses Customers:** When people search for you, they see a beautiful site with your opening hours (Tue Closed), location, and services—not just a plain Google listing.
>
> It puts you ahead of every other saloon in Ulhasnagar. Want to see a demo?"
